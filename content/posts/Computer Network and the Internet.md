**Overview**

- what is the internet / what is a protocal
- Network edge: hosts, access network, physical media
- Network core: packet/circuit switching, internet structure 
- Performance: loss delay throughput
- Protocol layers, service models 
- security 
- history 



## What is the Internet 

**1.what is internet** 



(The Internet: a "nuts and bolts" view)

Billions of conneted computing <u>devices</u>: 

- Hosts = end system 
- running network apps at Internet's "edge"

Packet switches: forward packets (chunks of data)

- routers, switches 

Communication links

- fiber, copper, radio, statellite
- transmission rate: bandwidth  

Networks 

- colloection of devices, rounters, links: managed by an organization

Internet: "networks of networks"

- interconnected ISPs

Protocols are everywhere 

- control sending, receiving of messages
- e.g. HTTP (Web), streaming video, Skype, TCP, IP, WiFi, 4G, Ethernet

Internet sandards

- RFC: Request for Comments
- IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force



(The Internet: a "services" view)

Infrastructure - that provides services to application 

- Web, streaming video, multimedia teleconferencing, email, games, e-commerce, social media, interconnected appliances

Provide programming interface - to distributed application 

- "hooks" allowing sending/receiving apps to "connect" to, use Internet transport service
- Provide service option, analogous to postal service 



**2.what is protocal** 

Human protocols:

- "what's the time?"
- "i have a question"
- introductions

Rules for:

- Specific messages sent
- Specific actiosn taken when message received, or other events 



Network protocols:

- Computer (devices) rather than humans
- all communication activity in Internet governed by protocols 



<u>Protocols</u> define the <u>format</u>, <u>order</u> of <u>messages sent and received</u> among network entities, and actions taken on msg transmission, receipts
